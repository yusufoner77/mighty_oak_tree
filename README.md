# mighty_oak_tree

This program uses a binary tree data structure to store Squirrel objects.

You can create a node and attach it to an existing node in the tree. You can also specify whether you want to connect the new node as the “left” or “right” child.

You can traverse the tree from the root to the leaves using left_node and right_node methods.

In order to run this program, you must be able to compile and run C++ programs on your machine.

To run the program:
```bash
g++ main.cpp && ./a.out
```
